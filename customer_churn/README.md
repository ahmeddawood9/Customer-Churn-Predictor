# Customer Churn Prediction – Clean Data Workflow

This project demonstrates an industry-style machine learning workflow for
tabular data using customer churn prediction.

## Current Status
At this stage, only the **data cleaning module** (`cleaning.py`) has been implemented.  
Further steps including feature engineering, model training, and evaluation will be added as the project progresses.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Automated data cleaning and preprocessing ✅ (implemented)
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers ✅ (implemented)
- Feature scaling and encoding using pipelines (upcoming)
- Class imbalance–aware modeling (upcoming)
- Random Forest and XGBoost models (upcoming)
- Evaluation focused on Confusion Matrix and Precision-Recall (upcoming)

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
